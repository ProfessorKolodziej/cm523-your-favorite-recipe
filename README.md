# Your Favorite Recipe

In this assignment, you'll be creating a single page website using HTML and CSS for your favorite recipe. 
What is a recipe? Anything that involves a set of ingredients and a set of directions. It could be a recipe 
for soup, a recipe for disaster - whatever your favorite recipe is, as long as there is a set of ingredients 
and a set of directions, go wild! Here's a [very simple example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10uYBUDpqmjEQomhREas3zqlwPIL7pT1q_1ca-_C4twc/edit?usp=sharing) I wrote up for the wireframing videos.

In part 1, your focus will be on writing valid, semantic HTML for the content of your recipe. In part 2, you 
will use the wireframes and mockup of your recipe to add images and write CSS for the recipe. Your goal is 
to keep the proper semantics of the HTML, while doing your best to acheive what you mocked up. You will have 
two weeks to write the CSS and lots of class time, so challenge yourself with a fun design!

## Requirements: Part 1

- [ ] All HTML is valid.
- [ ] Your recipe includes a title using an h1 tag.
- [ ] Your recipe includes an introduction paragraph.
- [ ] Your recipe includes ingredients, using the ul tag.
- [ ] Your recipe includes directions, using the ol tag.
- [ ] Your recipe source is cited and linked using an a tag.
- [ ] The order of your recipe content makes sense and reads easily. It is not reordered to accommodate your desktop layout, and could be read by a screen reader from top to bottom.
- [ ] All HTML tags are semantic, and divs/spans are avoided where possible.
- [ ] No heading levels are skipped - you used h1, h2, h3, etc in the correct order. (It's okay to use multiple of the same heading if they are the same level of importance.)
- [ ] Formatting, including indentation, spacing, etc, is consistent and easy to read.
- [ ] If you used AI assistance, you have sourced it using an HTML comment.

## Requirements: Part 2

- [ ] Your code still meets the requirements in Part 1.
- [ ] All CSS is valid.
- [ ] There is no inline CSS or CSS in style tags.
- [ ] Your CSS selectors use classes, not IDs.
- [ ] Your CSS classes are named in a way that's easy for another developer to read and understand.
- [ ] Your specificity is minimal, so other developers can easily override your CSS if needed later on.
- [ ] Your design renders consistently in the most recent version of Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. (You can use https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser to test this if you don't have them installed.)
- [ ] The finished product looks roughly like your mockup, minus any interactivity, animation, or functionality that might require JavaScript.

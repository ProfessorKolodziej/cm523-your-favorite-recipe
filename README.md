# Your Favorite Recipe

In this assignment, you'll be creating a single page website using HTML and CSS for your favorite recipe. 
What is a recipe? Anything that involves a set of ingredients and a set of directions. It could be a recipe 
for soup, a recipe for disaster - whatever your favorite recipe is, as long as there is a set of ingredients 
and a set of directions, go wild! Here's a [very simple example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10uYBUDpqmjEQomhREas3zqlwPIL7pT1q_1ca-_C4twc/edit?usp=sharing) I wrote up for the wireframing videos.

In part 1, your focus will be on writing valid, semantic HTML for the content of your recipe. In part 2, you 
will use the wireframes and mockup of your recipe to add images and write CSS for the recipe. Your goal is 
to keep the proper semantics of the HTML, while doing your best to acheive what you mocked up. You will have 
two weeks to write the CSS and lots of class time, so challenge yourself with a fun design!

## Requirements: Part 1

- [ ] All HTML is valid.
- [ ] You have chosen the most semantic HTML tags possible to mark up your content. *Hint: refer to the second lecture videos and ask questions in class if you're debating between two tags.*
- [ ] Your recipe includes a title, introduction paragraph, ingredients, and directions. You can include other content if you like, such as images.
- [ ] If the recipe is from a website or book, you have cited the source and marked it up appropriately.

## Requirements: Part 2

- [ ] All CSS is valid.
- [ ] Your HTML is still semantic and additional HTML tags required for styling, if any, are used sparingly.
- [ ] Your CSS selectors use classes, not IDs.
- [ ] Your CSS classes are named in a way that's easy for another developer to read and understand.
- [ ] Your specificity is minimal, so other developers can easily override your CSS if needed later on.
- [ ] Your design renders consistently in the most recent version of Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. (You can use https://www.browserstack.com/test-on-microsoft-edge-browser to test this if you don't have them installed.)
- [ ] The finished product looks roughly like your mockup, minus any interactivity, animation, or functionality that might require JavaScript.

## Finished Assignment Example

Hint: Use Inspect Element to double check your HTML and CSS.

## Get started by syncing with Glitch!

First time? Need some extra help getting set up? Check out [this tutorial video on Kaltura](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n).

Just need a quick refresher? [Try this part of the video instead.](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=783)

**Import this repository to your Glitch account**
- Copy the URL of this repository, then open [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) in a new tab.
- Click "New Project", then "Import from Github".
- Paste the URL of this repository into the dialog.
- Rename the project to something you will remember, like this repository name.

A new Glitch project with this code will appear. Now, you should set up the export so that when you're done editing in Glitch, Github will be able to see your changes, and you can check to see if you met the assignment requirements. This is the perfect time to test that connection.

**Export your changes from Glitch to Gibhub**
- Click "Tools" at the bottom of the page, and then click "Import and Export".
- Click "Export to Github".
- Return to this tab and grab your repository name. For example, `ProfessorKolodziej/example-assignment`.
- You're ready to work! When you're happy with what you have, export your changes, and then return to Github and [create a pull request](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=640) from the new branch Glitch creates. Your grading and feedback will happen here!
- Don't forget to [submit your pull request to Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825) when you're ready for my feedback.

## How grading and feedback works

This repository uses Autograding to check the basic assignment requirements. Once you pass these requirements, [send me a link to the pull request in Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825). I'll give you additional feedback on things like performance and coding style, so you know how to improve your code for next time.

## Local Development

If you'd like to run this project locally, [install the LTS version of node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), clone the repo and then:

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm start` to preview the app locally
3. `npm test` to run the tests

## About this repository

Automated feedback is heavily based on the work of [thawkin3](https://github.com/thawkin3/dom-testing-demo) and [d12](https://github.com/education/autograding-example-node), and uses Jest.
